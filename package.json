Expecially @Ylx ! I spent several days trying to get High Sierra on my new Hackintosh. The ./startosinstall didn't work after several attempts. So I tried Ylx's method. It took me a while to figure out his instructions but once I did, install went flawlessly. If you are total noob like me, here is what I did step by step(as best as I can remember).\r * Follow High Sierra fresh install guide to create USB boot drive\r * Insert and boot from USB\r * Run \"Install macOS High Sierra\" on clover screen\r * Again following the guide- format drive, Install OS, Select langue, Select drive...\r * system will restart.\r * Once back in clover select \"High Sierra\" drive\r * Once you reach the \"Could not install MacOS\" screen open \"terminal\" under \"Utilities\" in the top banner\r * Run Ylx's command...and wait for it to complete. Took about 5 min. for me\r * Restart\r * On clover screen select Restart\r * I restarted a gain for good measure\r * On clover screen select \"High Sierra\"\r * System will restart again, select \"High Sierra\"\r * I believe this is when the installation completed for me. Yay!",
